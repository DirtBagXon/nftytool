nftytool 1.0

nftytool is a tool for using the Infinity USB and Infinity USB phoenix 
card programmers. It also works for the less legitimate Digitech USB 
card programmer.

nftytool is based upon plugins which reside in the plugins directory chosen
in the config file 'nftytool.conf'.

Running 'nftytool -h' will give info on how to use the program. Most often
a plugin will be used and then help for that particular plugin is received
by running 'nftytool -p plugin -- -h'.

If you don't want to be root while running this program, you need to 
have read and write access to the device in /proc/bus/usb/XXX which is 
associated with your card programmer.
